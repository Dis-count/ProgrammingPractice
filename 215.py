# 788. Rotated Digits
# An integer x is a good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from x. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

# A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:

# 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,
# 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),
# 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and
# the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.
# Given an integer n, return the number of good integers in the range [1, n].


# Example 1:

# Input: n = 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
# Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: 0

# Example 3:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 10^4
